# 100x TypeScript Client SDK

Interact with the [100x decentralized exchange](https://100x.finance/) and trade pre-launch tokens, BTC, ETH, SOL, BLUR and other cryptocurrency perp futures with leverage. Live on [Blast](https://blast.io/en).

```bash
npm install 100x-client
# or
yarn add 100x-client
# or
pnpm add 100x-client
# or
bun install 100x-client
```

## Usage

Getting started is a simple case of importing the Client and instantiating an instance.

```ts
import HundredXClient from '100x-client'

const MY_PRIVATE_KEY = '0x...'

const Client = new HundredXClient(MY_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

The client can also accept a configuration object as the second parameter.

| Key          | Type                   | Default                        | Description                                                               |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| debug        | boolean                | false                          | Used to enable debug mode when running the client for additional logging. |
| environment  | 'testnet' \| 'mainnet' | 'testnet'                      | Specify the environment you wish to trade in.                             |
| rpc          | string                 | Blast RPC based on environment | Specify a custom RPC url to used.                                         |
| subAccountId | number                 | 1                              | Specify a sub-account ID to use. This can be from 1-255.                  |

```ts
import HundredXClient from '100x-client'

const CONFIG = {
  debug: false,
  environment: 'testnet',
  rpc: 'https://sepolia.blast.io',
  subAccountId: 1,
}
const MY_PRIVATE_KEY = '0x...'

const Client = new HundredXClient(MY_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

## Getting started

To get started, you will need to deposit funds and make a trade. Let's look at how we can do that now.

```ts
import HundredXClient from '100x-client'
import { OrderType, TimeInForce } from '100x-client/enums'

const MY_PRIVATE_KEY = '0x...'

const Client = new HundredXClient(MY_PRIVATE_KEY)

// Let's deposit 1000 USDB to get started. By default deposits are in USDB.
const { error, success, transactionHash } = await Client.deposit(1000)

// Now we can make an order. Let's go long on some ETH!
if (success) {
  const { error, order } = await Client.placeOrder({
    isBuy: true,
    orderType: OrderType.LIMIT,
    price: 2990,
    productId: 1002,
    quantity: 1,
    timeInForce: TimeInForce.GTC,
  })

  // Finally let's log out our order to check the details.
  console.log(order)
}
```
